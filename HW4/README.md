* Before you submit the problem set, make sure everything runs as expected. Go to the menu bar at the top of Jupyter Notebook and click `Kernel > Restart & Run All` . Your code should run from top to bottom with no errors. Failure to do this will result in loss of points.

* Each problem has their own answer cell. So write or code your answer to their designated cell. If you want to add addtional cells make sure to add them just below the designated cell.

* After you done with running your code, use `Ctrl` or `Command` + `p` then click `save as pdf` to save your homework as pdf file. Do not use pdf exporter feature of jupyter! You are not going to upload your `.ipynb` file we just need the `.pdf`.

* Use Slack hw4 channel to discuss the problems. But please be careful not to post an answer or part of an answer.
